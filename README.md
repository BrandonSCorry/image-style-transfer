### <p align='center'> **Neural image style transfer** in the (not IE) browser.

* **Create an acccount** to get started.

* **Upload your own image** or pick a preset and then `filter` it through a trained model image.

* **About Page**: Brief overview of project

* **Community Page**: See all user submitted styled images

* **Saved Page**: See all of your styled images

## Built With
* MERN full-stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - Dependency Management
* [Paperspace](http://www.paperspace/) - Model training
* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) - Cloud-storage of user images

## Heroku Deployment

###[Freaky-Styley Deployed](https://freakey-styley-brt2.herokuapp.com/) (this will build the React app on visit (free Heroku), so the first load may take some time.)

* Sign-Up is currently required to style transfer images and view/vote on the community page.

* As of now, the style transfer is done client-side, so your GPU will affect the image result

* **Goal** to use cloud servers to process result image for client
